## DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL (DOM)

> Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.
# DOM helps catalog the website into individual objects which can be selected and manipulated
# Our browser is reponsible for converting the webpage elements and other content into a DOM tree diagram document
