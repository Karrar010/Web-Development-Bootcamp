Bootstrap is Frontend library and this framwork was created at twitter.
It has pre-styled classes and is pretty handy when styling
and can be downloaded via link tag on the browser

Wireframing:
whenever it comes to designing a webpage we need to have an idea of our website which we can 
get by have a drawing of it and this drawing is called a low fidility representation, whereas a mockup
which is kinda futurestic image of our to be webpage.
But mockups tend to bog a developer as when creating it we try perfectionism which is tedious,
so to avoid this is to take help from other webpages for references.
(both the sketching and mockup are examples of Wireframing)

-----Bootstrap Grid Layout System-----
Bootstrap is tool which makes creating responsive websites easy, responsive here means that the website 
responds to the size of screen like in mobiles,laptops,ipads.

-----Bootstrap Containers-------
Container are basic block for bootstrap and are used to horizontally center or pad out the content 
Normal Container:
-> As we can see in the website through index.html(D:\Web Development\My Web Dev by Angela Yu\c5Introduction_to_Bootstrap\index.html) 
that the content in container is centered and is colored in red and is padded properly. Moreover, as we change the size of the
screen the container content dynamically responds to the change in size by changing containers width and maintains it centered & padded form.

Fluid Container:
-> A fluid is container which takes the whole width of the screen as in index.html file and when the screen sizes are changed it 
changes its size by adapting to size of screen and always taking 100% of the width of screen.
